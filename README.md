# Crab Bucket - a toy Rust database

Happy Fellow's learning playground - I decided to learn Rust and writing a
database is as good project as any for the goal. I've never written Rust nor
have I written a database before. Wish me luck!

## Guiding principles for the project:

- _Not too much code_: I want the codebase to stay lean, but no code golfing!
- _Reinvent the wheel_: I'm writing a database after all, I'll try to minimise
  the number of external libraries I depend on.

## Other notes

See `LOG.md` for a running log of my unedited thoughts as I work on the project.
